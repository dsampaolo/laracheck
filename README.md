# LaraCheck
Checks if Laravel's requirements are met on your webserver.

## Why ?

A client's server provider only sent me an FTP access to an unknown server, I had to check whether I could use Laravel as-is. 

## What it does

LaraCheck checks that the PHP version running on your server and PHP enabled extensions match Laravel's requirements.
It also displays the absolute path to the file.

## Usage

Simply clone the repo or copy both PHP files (index.php and Laracheck.class.php) anywhere on your server, in a web-accessible directory, such as /public.
Access the file with a browser. That's all.
